Sure, here's an example implementation of the Car class in Java, with fields for characteristics and a method for turning on the headlights, as well as overloaded constructors and methods to demonstrate the creation and use of a car instance twice:

public class Car {

    private String make;

    private String model;

    private int year;

    private boolean headlightsOn;

    

    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {

        this.make = make;

        this.model = model;

        this.year = year;

    }

    

    public Car(String make, String model, int year, boolean headlightsOn) {

        this.make = make;

        this.model = model;

        this.year = year;

        this.headlightsOn = headlightsOn;

    }

    

    public void turnOnHeadlights() {

        this.headlightsOn = true;

        System.out.println("Headlights are now turned on.");

    }

    

    public void turnOnHeadlights(int brightnessLevel) {

        this.headlightsOn = true;

        System.out.println("Headlights are now turned on to brightness level " + brightnessLevel + ".");

    }

    

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Car car1 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022, false);

        car1.turnOnHeadlights();

        

        Car car2 = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2022);

        car2.turnOnHeadlights(5);

    }

}
